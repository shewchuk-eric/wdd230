            <h2>Whitespace and Clean Design</h2>
            <span class="intro">
                <p>Kauai Juice Company</p>
                <p><a href="https://www.kauaijuiceco.com/">https://www.kauaijuiceco.com/</a></p>
            <img src="images/kauai-juice.jpg" alt="image of the kauai juice website at mobile size">
            <p class="explanation">The Kauai Juice Company website is a good example of Clean Design and White Space.  It uses clean, sans-serif fonts throughout with relatively large font size and short spans of text which together provide easy readability.  Images are bright with colors that are in harmony with other elements of the site.</p>

        <section class="example">
            <h2>Visual Hierarchy</h2>
            <span class="intro">
                <p>Kauai Athletic Club</p>
                <p><a href="https://kauaiathleticclub.com/">https://kauaiathleticclub.com/</a></p>
            <img src="images/kac.jpg" alt="image of the kauai athletic club website at mobile size">
            <p class="explanation">The Kauai Athletic Club uses the sizes of fonts and other elements to provide a visual hierarchy.  The logo at the top of the page is very small which is appropriate since a visitor should already know what site they've navigated too.  Therefore, the logo represents information of very little importance.  The main text at the top of the page, though, because of it's placement and much larger size than other text elements, is clearly the most important information in the view.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="example">
            <h2>Hick's Law</h2>
            <span class="intro">
                <p>Aloha Roofing Supply</p>
                <p><a href="https://aloharoofingsupply.com/">https://aloharoofingsupply.com/</a></p>
            <img src="images/aloha.jpg" alt="image of the aloha roofing supply website at mobile size">
            <p class="explanation">At first glance, the Aloha Roofing Supply website may not appear to be a great example of Hick's Law, especially on larger screens where elements are placed on a grid five items wide.  On closer inspection, though, it's clear that the site designers have done a good job of minimizing the amount of information on the page without abandoning important elements.  So, although the site displays a slide show and ten product category cards, it neatly organizes several hundred products and makes the individual products easy to find by way of category cards.</p>
